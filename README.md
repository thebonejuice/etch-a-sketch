# etch-a-sketch

This project aims to create a functional etch-a-sketch, conveniently and properly placed inside of a browser, proving my skills with CSS, HTML and JavaScript. 

Pre-project README: It is imperative I do not rely on AI for this project. I didn't with the others, really, but I don't wanna begin using it as a crutch. This project is certainly intimidating but if TOP is behind me, I suppose I can do this.

Post-project README: I did not use AI one single time, not even for the error messages (which there weren't any). This code is not the greatest, but with a little help from the TOP Discord and some research, I was able to conquer this Etch-A-Sketch Project.

Currently this project is only able to be fully utilized on computer, with MAYBE some small updates like color changing and such on the way. Otherwise, the final piece is set and I hope it is a great show of my skill.
