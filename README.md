# etch-a-sketch

This project aims to create a functional etch-a-sketch, conveniently and properly placed inside of a browser, proving my skills with CSS, HTML and JavaScript. 

Pre-project README: It is imperative I do not rely on AI for this project. I didn't with the others, really, but I don't wanna begin using it as a crutch. This project is certainly intimidating but if TOP is behind me, I suppose I can do this.
